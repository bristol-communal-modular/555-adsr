An ADSR envelope we've built for our eurorack systems.

This version is based on the schematic from Yves Usson at [YuSynth](https://www.yusynth.net/Modular/modular.html).
More information on it is available from the [relevant page on his site](https://www.yusynth.net/Modular/EN/ADSR/index_latest.html).
